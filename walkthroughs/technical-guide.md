# Technical Guide

## Home Page

You can design your home page however you'd like, but here are some starter ideas:

1. Add an image of your mentorship family using the `<img />` tag. Store your images in the resources folder. 
You can also add a direct link to the image, but let's store it locally for now. 

Example:
```bash
<img src="image_location" alt="Put Description Here" />
<img src="resources/dog.jpg" alt="Dog" />
```

2. Add any additional features you'd like before moving on to the navigation bar! Check out the example add-ons at the end of the technical guide. You can also do this at the end if you'd like!

## Navigation Bar

Check out these Bootstrap examples and tutorials for your navbar: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ 

If you think there is an error, a possible fix is changing the Bootstrap version to 4.1

If you would like to add a simpler navbar, you can reference w3schools here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp 

## About Us Page

You can use the [Bootstrap Grid model](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) that we covered in the slides to format your profiles. You may also use a different method that you feel more comfortable with. 

Each profile can include your:
* Name
* Picture
* Pronouns
* Year
* Major
* Fun facts
* LinkedIn
* GitHub
* Anything else you'd like to add!

## Gallery Page

Check out these Bootstrap examples and tutorials for your gallery: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/

If you think there is an error, a possible fix is changing the Bootstrap version to 4.1

You can select any of the carousels you'd like and customize it however y'all want! 
Feel free to reference the dawgs repository's gallery page as well.
